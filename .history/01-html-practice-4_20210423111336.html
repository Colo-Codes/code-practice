            <section>
                <p>What are YOU doing here? Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. The
                    existence of the sea means the existence of pirates. Right from the Voyage og Noah, surviving was by
                    sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides. Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon
                    through your porthole? They don’t call me Long John because my head is so big. There comes a time in
                    most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. Even pirates, before they attack
                    another ship, hoist a black flag. If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to
                    sink with her. “Yes, I do heartily repent. I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did
                    not cut the throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as
                    we. ” Piracy – Hostile take over. Without the messy paperwork. Ahoy! lets trouble the water!</p>
