            <h3>Things to consider beforrrrrre embarking</h3>
            <p>That’s some treasure chest you’ve got there. That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good
                scabbard! Take what you can, give nothing back Even pirates, before they attack another ship, hoist a
                black flag. It is when pirates count their booty that they become mere thieves.</p>
            <p>Have ya ever met a man with a real yardarm? C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Why is the rum gone? Drink up
                me hearties yoho …a pirates life for me Pirate’s code: First freedom and the captain. Second the loot,
                third woman and the rum and at the end no mercy if they not immediately surrender!</p>

                yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate. you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched
                that man sail away with my ship. Arrrrrrrr </p>
            <p>Avast, me proud beauty! Wanna know why my Roger is so Jolly? Have ya ever met a man with a real yardarm?
                Well blow me down? Where there is a sea there are pirates. My mom would not let me see the pirate movie
                because it was rated rrrrr.</p>
